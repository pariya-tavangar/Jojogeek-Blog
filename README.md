# WIP PROJECT
*A work-in-progress personal blog, built with Django (and maybe too much coffee).*  

## ðŸŒ± Current Status  

What works:  
* Basic blog posts  
* Ugly-but-functional admin panel  
* It doesn't crash (most of the time)  

What I'm tinkering with:  
- User accounts (so my cat can't post)  
- UI design idea
- Users being able to leave comments 

Dream features (if I ever finish the basics):  
+ Dark mode
+ Emoji support 
+ A "random old post" button
